# Cocktail Bar

A simple Android app to store cocktail recipes.

My friends and I will occasionally have a cocktail night, where we invent new recipes. The apps on the play store were either too generic (like a note-taking app) or too complex (requiring manual linking between ingredients and recipes).

This app has the recipe entered as text, and links to ingredients so that they can be filtered by what we have in stock.

This is an exploration project I used for learning flutter.
